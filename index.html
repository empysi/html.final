<b>Brief summary about Plastic waste </title></head></b>
    <p>"Ocean plastic pollution is overwhelmingly caused by 'Mismanaged plastic waste' - this means that plastic litter is not collected and dealt with by recycling or incineration, but rather simply discarded into the environment and not cleaned up."(summary from ijeast.com)</p>
    <h1></h1>
    <h2>Plastic polution  </h2>
   
    <b>Problems plastic polution causes </b> <i>
<p> </b>Plastic polution causes destruction of habitat to diffrent types of speacies it also cause micro plastics to go into littel fishes which human eat and cause the humans eating to get severly sick and possibly die.</u></p>
 
 
<p>Here are some problems plastic polution causes that i got from ijeast.com
"
Plastics consist of major toxic pollutants having the potential to cause important harm to the environment in the form of water, land and air pollution. Plastic is a material that is non- biodegradable, hence it can wreak havoc on natural environment resulting into long-term issues for animals, plants and humans."


Can you imagine that all of this harm to diffrent speciest and all of the harm done to the food source humans such as fishers need are getting harmed just because humans waste all thier plastic and dont recycle. The countireis that need to really change are these countires




 <h2>Plastic polution  Rank	Annual Ocean Plastic Waste</h2>
"#1	ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ Philippines	356,371

#2	ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ India	126,513

#3	ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾ Malaysia	73,098

These 3 counries arent actually the counties who produce the most plastic but are the countries who have the worse wate mangement sysyem which the polutes thier own counties causing alot of dirty ness and disesases to spread the thier most rural area with the most plastic waste".



 <h2>The countrie who is doing best to maintain a clean enviorment </h2>
 I got this information from https://good-with-money.com/
 "Rwanda. In 2008, it became the world's first 'plastic-free' nation, 10 years after it introduced a ban on all plastic bags and plastic packaging. Unlike many other countries, Rwanda is strict at enforcing its ban. Anyone caught with a plastic item in the country faces a jail sentence of up to six months"
