  <h1>How to solve Plastic Polution </h1>
  <h2>Now how should we stop Air pollution</h2>
  <b>Resolution </b> <I>Plastic polution is mostly caused by Mismanaged plastic waste which is mainly caused in rural areas of the world so what we can do is that goverments all over the world can come up with a plastic waste cleansing system all aound cities over the world where people would be givin jobs just clean the streets and ocean and etc.</I>

<h1>Model country  </h1>
Rwanda in recent years have made tremendous growth in development and this also includes its plastic mangement system according to intechopen(i put the link under)"Rwanda has evolved as one of the African countries pioneering in waste management and recycling, taking a practical system in which the environment and climate change are at the core of all policies, programs, strategies, and plans". This is a great example of a county thats trying to help and reduce the damge plastic polution causes if this were to be applied other big industriliezed countryies plastic pollution would decrease by HUGE margin we would have less se life going extinct.


 <h1>Policies that should be enforced </h1>

Another thing that rwanda has done to reduce plastic waste is that anyone caugt with un recycble or un provided plastic from in the country you can face jail sentance to up to 6 monts in my opinion this is a wonderfull rule because it enough to scare people away and not waste or us plastic without thinking of the damage its causing.   Here is a chart showing the amount of waste caused by plastic in rwanda back in 1994 compared to in 2021<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/2.9.4/Chart.js"></script>
